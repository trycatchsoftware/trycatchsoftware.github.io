      <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
          Database migrations are a way to make database schema changes in a
          safe and predictable way. This article is not about implementing
          database migrations with any specific tool or framework but will cover
          best practices for how to design and run database migrations in
          general.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most of the points below refer to managing SQL databases since this is
          what they are most commonly used for although a lot of them apply just
          as well to any database technology.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Note:</strong> This article is about migrating the shape of
          database schemas not about migrating data from one database instance
          to another.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 id="writing-migrations">Writing Migrations</h2>

        <h3 id="up-down-migrations">Create Both Up &amp; Down Migrations</h3>
        <p>
          Most database migration tools have the concept of each migration
          having both an 'up' and 'down' component. The 'up' component is used
          to migrate the current database structure to a new state and the
          'down' component is used to reverse those changes.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's important to define both an 'up' and a 'down' component for every
          migration. This has the following benefits:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            It's easy to rollback migrations that have just been deployed in
            case something went wrong
          </li>
          <li>
            It's easy to recreate the database structure from any point in your
            application's history which can help with debugging
          </li>
          <li>
            It forces you to think about whether you are making potentially
            destructive changes
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Keep Migrations in Version Control</h3>

        <p>
          Version control your migrations alongside your code. It should be
          possible to recreate the database structure at any commit in your
          codebase's history such that the code will work with the database
          structure defined in the migrations present in that commit.
        </p>

        <h3>Keep Migrations Small and Focused</h3>

        <p>
          As with all code, it's better to keep the changes applied by an
          individual migration as small and focused as possible. This makes them
          more predictable to apply and easier to roll back. If a feature
          requires multiple unrelated changes to the database it's better to
          split them into separate migrations even if they all get applied in a
          single deployment.
        </p>

        <h3>Test Your Migrations</h3>

        <p>
          Always test your migrations on a non-production database before
          running them in production. This gives you a chance to catch and fix
          any issues before they affect your production data. You should test
          both 'up' and 'down' migrations.
        </p>

        <h3>Avoid Long Running Migrations</h3>

        <p>
          Long-running migrations can lock your tables for the duration of the
          migration, causing downtime. To avoid this, you can break up large
          migrations into smaller ones that run in quick succession.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some databases have features that can help with zero-downtime
          migrations. For example, PostgreSQL has the
          <code
            ><a
              href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createindex.html#SQL-CREATEINDEX-CONCURRENTLY"
              >CONCURRENTLY</a
            ></code
          >
          keyword which allows you to add indexes without locking the table.
          MySQL has the concept of
          <a
            href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-online-ddl-operations.html"
            >online DDL operations</a
          >.
        </p>

        <h3>Migrate Existing Data and Default Values</h3>

        <p>
          When creating migrations that change structure, make sure that
          existing data is also taken into account in the migration. For
          example, if converting a column from nullable to non-nullable, you
          should provide a default value for the column so that existing rows
          are not affected. Alternatively if moving a column from one table to
          another, you should ensure that the data is copied over correctly as
          part of the migration.
        </p>

        <h3>Don't Seed Data with Migrations</h3>

        <p>
          There is a difference between database migrations and database
          seeders. Migrations control the structure of your database as well as
          making sure any existing data is compatible with that new structure.
          They are not responsible for adding new data into the database. This
          is the job of seeders. Most migration tools have both the concept of
          migrations and of seeders.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's important to keep these two concerns separate. This makes it
          easier to reason about the state of the database at any point in time
          and makes it easier to recreate the database from scratch.
        </p>

        <h3 id="backward-forward-compatibility">
          Backward &amp; Forward Compatibility
        </h3>

        <p>
          When writing migrations it's important to consider the order that they
          are run compared to any associated code changes being applied. Even in
          the simplest deployment pipelines it's highly unlikely that the code
          will be updated at exactly the same time as the database. In more
          complex systems it might even be the case that different parts of the
          code might be updated at different times, in a staggered or
          'eventually consistent' approach, even if they all point to the same
          database.
        </p>

        <p>
          This means that there is a period of time where the database schema
          might be in a state that is not compatible with the code that is
          running against it. This can lead to errors, data corruption, or
          unexpected behavior.
        </p>

        <p>
          One way around this is to design your database migrations so that they
          are <strong>backward compatible</strong>. In other words, both the
          current version of the code and the new version of code will still
          work after the migrations have run. You should follow this approach if
          your migrations are run <strong>before</strong> the code is updated.
        </p>

        <p>
          An alternative is to make your code
          <strong>forward compatible</strong>. In other words, your code can
          handle the database being in either its current structure or its new
          structure. You should follow this approach if your migrations are run
          <strong>after</strong> the code is updated.
        </p>

        <p>
          Generally, it's much easier to make your migrations backward
          compatible than to make your code forward compatible.
        </p>

        <h3>Stagger Destructive Changes</h3>

        <p>
          One approach to allow your database migrations to be backward
          compatible is to stagger destructive changes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many changes are additive and are inherently backward compatible. Some
          examples would be:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Adding a new table</li>
          <li>Adding a new column to a table</li>
          <li>
            Increasing the capacity of a column's datatype (e.g. from
            VARCHAR(25) to VARCHAR(255))
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          However, some changes are destructive and are not backward compatible.
          Some examples would be:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Dropping a table</li>
          <li>Dropping a column</li>
          <li>Renaming a column</li>
          <li>Changing the type of a column</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          When making destructive changes, it's best to stagger them across
          multiple migrations to maintain backward compatibility at all times.
          For example, if you need to drop a column, you could have the
          following set of individual deployments:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Change the code to stop using the column meaning that no new data is
            being written to it
          </li>
          <li>
            Migrate the database to rename the column, indicating that it should
            be considered deleted. This still gives the opportunity to rollback
            the migration if needed using the 'down' migration.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, permanently drop the column. This migration would
            inherently have no 'down' migration.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          A similar set of separate deployments could be used to rename a
          column:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Create a migration that creates a column with the new name, leaving
            the existing one as it is. Copy over the existing data to the new
            column and use something like triggers to keep the new column data
            in sync with the old.
          </li>
          <li>
            Update the code to use the new column name instead of the old one
          </li>
          <li>
            Drop the old column. This can still be rolled back by creating a
            'down' migration that copies the newly named column back to the old
            one. Any created triggers can also be removed at this point.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Applying Migrations</h2>

        <p>
          Migrations should ideally be performed as part of an automated
          deployment pipeline. The execution order compared to deploying code
          changes should be considered and migrations and code changes should be
          designed accordingly (see the section on
          <a href="#backward-forward-compatibility"
            >Backwards &amp; Forwards Compatibility</a
          >).
        </p>

        <h3>Zero-Downtime Migrations</h3>

        <p>
          It should always be the aim to design database migrations so that they
          can be deployed without application downtime. Following all of the
          advice in the
          <a href="#writing-migrations">Writing Migrations</a> section should go
          a long way towards achieving this.
        </p>

        <h3>Database Backups</h3>

        <p>
          Even with the concept of 'down' migrations, it's still possible for
          data corruption to occur and mistakes to be made. It's highly
          advisable to take a backup of the database before running any
          migrations, especially in production environments.
        </p>

        <h3>Rollbacks</h3>

        <p>
          There should be a documented and simple way to rollback any applied
          database migrations. Most migration tools support this.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Managing Migrations</h2>

        <h3>Squashing</h3>

        <p>
          As you build your application, you may accumulate more and more
          migrations over time. This can lead to your codebase becoming bloated
          with potentially hundreds of migrations. If you would like, you may
          "squash" your migrations into a single SQL file. Many tools support
          this feature but it should be considered that once squashed, it is not
          possible to rollback to a specific migration before that point.
