  </div>

  <p><a href="https://buyanypart.co.uk">Buy Any Part</a> is an online marketplace for spare parts.
  Try Catch Software worked alongside founder Chris Hansen and digital project specialists
  <a href="https://www.tallprojects.co.uk">Tall Projects</a> to deliver a new website platform
  to replace their existing solution which was not meeting the needs of the business.</p>

  <p>As part of the project we:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Designed and built a storefront capable of organising, searching and selling
      potentially millions of products</li>
    <li>Built a custom back-office system for managing the storefront, suppliers, inventory, and orders</li>
    <li>Created an order processing system to handle the custom fulfillment, payment and commission
      model used by the business</li>
    <li>Developed a highly scalable import and bulk update functionality to allow large amounts of data to
      be managed quickly and reliably without affecting the perfomance of the site</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Some of the tools and technologies we employed were:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://medium.com/@mjackson/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9#.bi3p1u3j8">Universal</a> <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> for the storefront, maximising usability whilst remaining SEO friendly</li>
    <li><a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> for the back-office system user interface</li>
    <li><a href="https://nodejs.org">NodeJS</a> and <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a> to provide a set of scalable APIs based around a microservices architecture</li>
    <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> for scalable and resilient cloud services</li>
    <li><a href="https://codeship.com/">Codeship</a> for continuous integration and delivery</li>
    <li>Agile project management and test-driven development were used throughout the project</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Buy Any Part now offers over 300,000 products and continues to grow its catalogue
    and sales.</p>
  <p>Try Catch Software continues to work as the development provider for Buy Any Part.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>I started working with Tim and Try Catch for the most recent iteration of my website.</p>

      <p>Tim built a market place web service appropriate to the stage of our business but with an
      eye on the future. The front end is clean and fast but most importantly the admin and inventory
      management platform are robust, scaled and flexible. I feel we have a future proof foundation
      to build on new function when required.</p>

      <p>In the day to day operations Tim demonstrates a desire to represent and support your business.
      As with any new or growth business with a continuous development programme there will be issues
      and snags along the way but Tim takes them in his stride. Problems are resolved quickly,
      communication is clear and Tim always makes himself available.</p>

      <p>I hope to keep Tim with us in whatever direction our business takes.</p>
