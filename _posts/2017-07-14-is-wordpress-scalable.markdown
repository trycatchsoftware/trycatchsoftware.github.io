excerpt: "What challenges do agencies face when managing multiple Wordpress sites at scale?"
---

Wordpress powers an estimated [18 million](https://trends.builtwith.com/cms) self-hosted websites<sup>[*](#footnote)</sup>. The popular CMS powers high profile sites including [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/) and [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/). Wordpress has evolved from a blogging platform into a fully featured content management system. This enables agencies to produce beautiful, feature rich websites. But, what challenges does the evolution of the core function of Wordpress present when managing multiple sites at scale?

- **Security: the [most frequently reported](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=wordpress+security&tbm=nws) Wordpress issue.** Out of date installations and plugins often contain undetected bugs and vulnerabilities. Keeping sites up to date and fully functional requires skill and time. Some existing tools can help reduce these problems, but how else can you optimise the process of rolling out seamless updates across multiple sites?

- **Scalability: more cost effective and automated scaling.** Web based software commonly uses [horizontal scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability#Horizontal_and_vertical_scaling) to allocate resources in line with demand. The architecture of Wordpress presents challenges that make this difficult. Most Wordpress hosting encourages multiple sites on a single server. This makes scaling of individual sites difficult and automating it even harder. How can the architecture of Wordpress be changed to take advantage of modern cloud platforms and reduce costs?

- **Maintainability: reusing and managing your companyâ€™s code.** Plugins and themes allow developers to share and reuse work that has been done before. Companies always have their own code that they cannot share with the wider world. Wordpress does not provide a simple and secure way of managing and distributing this code. How can we keep all the benefits of plugins and themes without giving away all our secrets?

- **Workflow: making development easier.** Wordpress does little to make applying development best practices easy. Creation of development and testing environments, automated deployments and testing are all difficult and time consuming to achieve. How can we apply software development tooling to Wordpress to make it quicker, easier and more reliable to develop and manage websites?

Wordpress is a widely used and powerful tool but it is not without its flaws, particularly when used in a commercial setting. By applying some of the principles borrowed from software development it is possible to make life considerably easier for both clients and developers. This will reduce development and operational costs as well as providing a better experience for all involved.

Over the next few articles we will discuss each of the problems outlined above in more detail and, more importantly, the potential solutions that could be used to solve them.
